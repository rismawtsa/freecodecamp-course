### - Learn About Functional Programming

Functional programming is about:

- Isolated functions - there is no dependence on the state of the program, which includes global variables that are subject to change
- Pure functions - the same input always gives the same output
- Functions with limited side effects - any changes, or mutations, to the state of the program outside the function are carefully controlled
